## 🧐 What does it do?
It fetches live NAV data from AMFI and plots a "Rebased to 100" chart. This allows you to compare funds (like an Equity fund vs. a Debt fund) on a level playing field to see how ₹100 invested in each would have grown over time.

## 🚀 Features
- **Live Data:** Connects directly to the AMFI Public API.
- **Privacy First:** No personal data is stored.
- **Interactive:** Zoom, pan, and hover over the charts.
- **Guestbook:** Leave a note on the integrated Padlet wall!
